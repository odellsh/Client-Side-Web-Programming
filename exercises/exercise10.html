    <p class="first">If you want to center a box on the page (or center
      it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the left-
      margin and right-margin to auto.</p>
    <p class="second">In order to center a box on the page, you need to
      set the width for the box (otherwise it will take up the full
      width of the page. <strong>NOTE</strong> that the preceding
      sentence is only true if you are using auto as the margin. If you
      simply set the left and right margin to the same value, like 10em,
      the box will center and you DO NOT need a width. <strong>None of
      these paragraphs need a width</strong>.</p>
    <p class="third">Once you have specified the width of the box,
      setting the left and right margins to auto will make the browser
      put an equal gap on each side of the box. This centers the box on
      the page (or within the element that the box sits inside).</p>
    <p class="fourth">In order for this to work in older browsers
      particularly IE6), the element that the box sits inside should
      have a text-align property with its value set to center.</p>
    <p class="fifth">The text-align property is inherited by the child
      elements.  You therefore also need to specify the text-align
      property on the centered box if you do not want the text inside to
      be centered.</p>
