    <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
        <p>Emma Watson <s>was a junior</s> is now a senior and a <abbr title="Computer Science">Comp Sci</abbr> major at <strong>Appalachian State University</strong>. 
      She was born on Febraury 8<sup>th</sup>, 2000 and has one younger sister. Her first love was swimming and 
      diving, and she was quite successful at it aswell. After starting to swim semi-professionally<sub>1</sub>, she began 
      to not like the sport as much. It was very mentally draining for a 12 year old, and she was 
      always at either school or the pool. After a tailbone fracture, dislocated shoulder, and hip injury, 
      she finally deciced to retire from the sport and focus on her other preferred hobbies, one of which 
      being music.</p>
        <p>Emma started to play the flute in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, and always seemed to do well with this instrument. 
      Swim had always come first, but after retiring she decided to take music more seriously. She began to 
      practice more outside of school, and her teacher decided to put her in state-wide competitions. At first 
      she would get incredibly nervous on stage and wouldn't perform at her best, but with time she began to 
      love performing her favorite pieces and capturing the audience with her music for just a couple minutes. 
      As much as she loved flute, band, and performing, her high school band teacher retired after her Junior 
      year and the new teacher wasn't as much fun to work with. She decided it was time to quit performing, 
      but she still has her flute and tries to play as often as she can.</p>
        <p>After quitting band, Emma was looking for another hobby that she could see herself having a long 
      career in. She mentioned Computer Science to her father, and together they found family friends that 
      would let her job shadow their webpage design projects, and she immediately knew this was something 
      she could seriously see herself doing years down the line.</p>
        <p><sub>1</sub>: Emma swam for YOTA, YMCA of the Triangle Area.

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>After graduating I hope to find a career with webpage design. I enjoy the creative freedom I can 
      have, aswell as being able to create something alot of people may see and interact with. I understand 
      that having an actual career involving webpage design means I wouldn't have as much creative freedom, 
      but I don't mind that small downside.</p>
        <p>I'd love to work for a <em>smaller company</em> somewhere in Europe, since that is where I'd like to live 
      eventually. I'd prefer a smaller company since there's a larger chance I'd be able to know everyone 
      that works around and with me. I love to socialize with my co-workers, so I feel like working with 
      a smaller company would give me a better chance to have stronger relationships with the people I work 
      with.</p>
